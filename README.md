# Element collages

### What is it?
Element collages is a free exploration of possible design directions for the new university website.

### Benefit for the client
It will help the client have an idea on how the website will look like. It is better than a mockup up because you avoid to waste time during your discussion on details that are not important at this early stage. Instead you will focus on the atmosphere and the feeling.

> This particular phrase creates an expectation that what we’re looking at isn’t a final design but rather an assembly of disparate pieces without specific logic or order.

### Benefit for the designer
From the designer point of view it's easier to design such a thing because you do just what it comes naturally to your mind. Something which is impossible to avoid during the production of a mockup because you are constrain to draw all necessary elements of a web page. It also helps you focus more on modules and less on pages.
